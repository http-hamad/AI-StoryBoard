# StoryBoard AI

## Overview
StoryBoard AI is an **efficient and powerful Streamlit-based application** that leverages the latest AI models to convert images into stories, generate storyboards, and create AI-generated images from text. This project utilizes state-of-the-art models like **DeepSeek**, **Gemini**, and **Flux AI**, ensuring high-quality outputs while maintaining **optimized performance** through caching, parallel processing, and lightweight image handling.

## Features

- **Image to Story** â€“ Upload an image, get an AI-generated caption, and turn it into a compelling short story.
- **Storyboard Mode** â€“ Upload multiple images and generate a coherent story based on them.
- **Story to Image** â€“ Provide a text-based story, and the system will generate AI-powered visuals based on its content.
- **Efficient Model Execution** â€“ Uses **optimized caching and GPU/CPU detection** for faster AI processing.
- **Parallel Image Generation** â€“ Uses **ThreadPoolExecutor** to speed up AI-generated images in Story-to-Image mode.
- **Custom API Key Management** â€“ Allows users to input their own API keys for better flexibility and security.

## Cutting-Edge AI Models Used

### Text Generation
- **DeepSeek [(deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b)](https://console.groq.com/playground?model=deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b)** â€“ Provides high-quality, long-form AI story generation with natural storytelling capabilities.  
- **Google Gemini [(gemini-1.5-flash)](https://gemini.google.com/app)** â€“ A fast and efficient model that generates structured, creative stories.

### Image Captioning
- **BLIP [(Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base)](https://huggingface.co/Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base)** â€“ A highly optimized model that generates accurate captions for uploaded images.

### AI-Generated Art
- **Flux AI [(fal-ai/flux/schnell)](https://fal.ai/models/fal-ai/flux/schnell)** â€“ A next-generation model for fast, high-quality AI image generation.

## Performance Optimizations

### Efficient AI Model Loading
- Uses `@st.cache_resource` to **cache models** and avoid redundant reloading.
- Automatically **selects the best device** (CUDA, MPS, or CPU) for optimal performance.

### Optimized Image Processing
- Uses `thumbnail(512, 512)` for **faster image handling** while maintaining aspect ratio.
- Resizes input images (`resize(384, 384)`) to speed up processing.

### Parallel Image Generation
- **Uses `ThreadPoolExecutor`** for concurrent image generation, reducing latency in Story-to-Image mode.

### API Response Handling & Caching
- AI-generated images are **cached** to reduce redundant API calls.
- Error handling mechanisms prevent crashes due to failed API requests.
